\begin{Frame}
\noindent {\bf \\1. Abstract}
\smallskip\\
The size and shape from distribution of variable stars\\
age from the number distribution of variable stars\\
\end{Frame}



\noindent {\bf 2. Description of the Proposed Program}
\smallskip\\
\noindent {\it A) Scientific Rationale:}
\smallskip\\
%Give the scientific background of your proposed study.
\begin{itemize}
	\item{} Use gri data to identify variable stars
	\item{} Use Period-Luminosity relationship to get distance
	\item{} Map 3D spatial distribution
	\item{} Determine deviation of variable stars from model
	\item{} Variations arise from non-gravitational effects
	\item{} Figure out dark matter distribution
\end{itemize}


\noindent {\it B) Immediate Objective:}
\smallskip\\
%State what you are proposing to observe and what the goals of the proposed study are. \\
Measure the size, shape, and age of Milky Way spiral arms.  \\
\noindent {\bf 3. Scientific Justification of Requested Observing Time, Feasibility, and Visibility}
\smallskip\\
\\

\noindent {\bf 4. Technical Justification of Duplication} %Only for observing proposals
\smallskip\\
%It is the responsibility of the proposers to check the proposed observations against the catalog of previously executed observations or accepted programs.  If any duplication exists, it must be identified and justified in the proposal.\\

\noindent {\bf 5. Report on Previous Swift and Related Programs}
\smallskip\\
%Here you can report on previous studies (with Swift or non-Swift) that are related to this proposal. \\ If you had a proposal accepted during the past 3 Swift Cycles (Cycle 9, 10, 11), you MUST give results here. \\

\noindent {\bf 6. References}
\smallskip\\
{\small
Author1 A.\ et al., YYYY, Journal, Vol., page \\
}

\noindent {\bf 7. Budget Narrative} % Only for funding proposal
\smallskip\\
%If you request funds, give a description of how the funds will be used and the scale of workforce needed  to carry out the investigation. Give sufficient details and actual numbers to allow us to judge your effort.  The page limit of the Budget Narrative section is 1-page, which will NOT count toward the overall page limit of your proposal.
